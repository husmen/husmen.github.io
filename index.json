It is bound up with the early modern period of history. Historical newspapers are of utmost importance to nations and its people, and researchers from different disciplines rely on these papers to improve our understanding of the past. In pursuit of satisfying this need, Istanbul University Head Office of Library and Documentation provides access to a big database of scanned historical newspapers. To take it another step further and make the documents more accessible, we need to run optical character recognition (OCR) and named entity recognition (NER) tasks on the whole database and index the results to allow for full-text search mechanism. We design and implement a system encompassing the whole pipeline starting from scrapping the dataset from the original website to providing a graphical user interface to run search queries, and it manages to do that successfully. Proposed system provides to search people, culture and security-related keywords and to visualise them.\n","date":1616284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616284800,"objectID":"d1fdbc3651bdeb85c91b55d2b6ab771b","permalink":"https://husmen.xyz/publications/ocr2021/","publishdate":"2021-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/ocr2021/","section":"publications","summary":"This work provides a full text search engine from scans of a historical collection of Turkish newspapers (1928–1942).","tags":["NLP","OCR","NER","Data journalism","Full-text search","Historical newspapers"],"title":"Searchable Turkish OCRed historical newspaper collection 1928–1942","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A full-text search engine from scans of a historical collection of Turkish newspapers (1928–1942).

This paper describes a reproducible research plan on mini autonomous race car programming. This educational plan is designed and implemented as part of a summer internship program at Kocaeli University and it consists of theoretical courses and laboratory assignments. A literate programming approach with the Python language is used for programming the race car. To assess the educational program’s impact on the learning process and to evaluate the acceptance and satisfaction level of students, they answered an electronic questionnaire after finishing the program. According to students’ feedback, the reproducible educational program is useful for learning and consolidating new concepts of mini autonomous car programming.\n","date":1579651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579651200,"objectID":"cda0060774ab1ed02313874d3f95b164","permalink":"https://husmen.xyz/publications/racecar2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/racecar2020/","section":"publications","summary":"An educational plan to teach university students autonomous car programming.","tags":["Autonomous Driving","Object Detection","Computer Vision","Deep Learning","ROS"],"title":"A Reproducible Educational Plan to Teach Mini Autonomous Race Car Programming","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Artificial Algae Algorithm, Implementation in Python and Cuda C++ with a dozen of optimization functions. Artificial algae algorithm (AAA) is a novel bio-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm proposed by Sait AliUymaz The algorithm is based on an evolutionary process, adaptation process and the movement of micro-algae. Artificial algae correspond to each solution in the problem space by idealizing the characteristics of algae. Similar to the real algae, artificial algae can move toward the source of light to photosynthesize with helical swimming, and they can adapt to the environment, are able to change the dominant species and can reproduce by mitotic division. Thus, the algorithm was composed of 3 basic parts called “Evolutionary Process”, “Adaptation” and “Helical Movement”.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f15fdbb1ff5f1403d8c7f3aa93f1277a","permalink":"https://husmen.xyz/portfolio/aaa/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/portfolio/aaa/","section":"portfolio","summary":"Python and Cuda C++ implementation of Artificial Algae Algorithm.","tags":["Python","Cpp","CUDA"],"title":"Artificial Algae Algorithm","type":"portfolio"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Implementation of Eight-Point Algorithm in C++.
